description: This project is an action Hack & Slash video game tribute to The Witcher series, result of a team of 30 people, a whole class of students in third course. It is a cooperative game for two players, which will have to play as Geralt or Jaskier, each one with their different abilities and combat style, and overcome waves of different types of enemies to manage to get their way to the victory. To create it we developed our own game engine, Broken Engine, using C++ and a group of open third-party libraries, such as OpenGL, PhysX or Recast, and using Lua as our scripting language.
comment: "The Witcher: Ties of Destiny is considered one of the most impressive games ever developed in the Design and Development of Video Games Bachelor’s Degree and in the Master's Degree by its Jesús Alonso, former director of the degree and master in question, and by Ricard Pillosu, former Crytek Development Director and Technical Manager. Their testimonials are visible to read in the web of the project."
contribution:
    - "Scripting System: Homogenization for all scripting functions, programmed several of those functions myself. Script initialization, save and load of scripts and variable editing from the engine inspector."
    - "Pause Menu: Whole development of the in-game pause menu."
    - "Main Menu: Programming the main menu and building its scene in the engine."
    - "Tutorial: Developed part of the steps of the tutorial."
    - "Screamer Ghoul: An agile and elusive enemy that tries to be at a certain distance from the players from where it can annoy them and constantly summon lesser monsters."
    - "Enemy Distribution: Tested spawner positions to check the performance and balancing the waves of enemies."
    - "QA: Playtesting the game looking for bugs and ensuring it had the desired difficulty."
