description: The Cliffborn Islands is a 2D platformer game that was purely developed with C++ with SDL by a couple of second year students. We used Tiled for the creation of the two levels of the game, and it has different enemies that use pathfinding to try to attack the player, who can attack them or scape. Furthermore, the game has a save and load system that uses XML files.
comment: Even though it was not demanded from us we also decided to implement a hook to provide more mobility and more variety of platforming tools for the player. It was quite an interesting challenge.
contribution: 
    - Creation and implementation of the graphic user interface system.
    - Programmed the collision system.
    - Controls and mechanics of the player and the hook.
    - Capped the game to 60 FPS and normalized the movement of the entities using delta time.
    - Design and creation of the second level.
    - Creation of the logotype.
