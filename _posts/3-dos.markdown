description: DOS Attack is a simple multiplayer game developed by two 4th grade students. In it you control a computer system that surfs through a network and that battles with up to 4 other players to see which one can get more kills. Being a reskined space shooter, the objective is to send Denial-of-Service attacks from your PC to the other computer systems that are connected to the game until you shut them down, at the same time you move to avoid theirs.
