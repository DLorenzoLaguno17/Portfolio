description: The Cliffborn Islands is a 2D platformer game that was developed by a couple of second year students. We used Tiled for the creation of the two levels of the game, and it has different enemies that use pathfinding to try to attack the player, who can attack them or scape. Even though it was not demanded from us we also decided to implement a hook to provide more mobility and platforming tools for the player.
