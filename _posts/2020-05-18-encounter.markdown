description: Radical Encounter is a God Game in which the player is in charge of a group of activists that are defending their little village against a series of different enemy soldiers. They are going to attack them and also damage the buildings and the infrastructure of the place, so you will have both to assist the people and repair the patrimony, all with the help of the resources you will acquire by slaining and saving your comrades. We programmed the artifficial intelligence and the behaviour of all the characters.
