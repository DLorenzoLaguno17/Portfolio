description: Cursed Heaven is an isometric RPG Roguelike video game based in Final Fantasy Tactics that was developed in C++ by seven students in second course. In it you have two different characters with their own abilities that must overcome all sorts of enemies and two bosses, one for each level, in order to beat the game. There is also a shop in each level where you can buy health potions or improve your character's statistics.
