description: Percularity is a a game engine programmed from scratch with C++ using open third-party libraries. It was developed in third course by two students. The purpouse of the subject was to build a game engine useful enough it could allow us to develop a game with the whole class as a big team. Using pairs, each team developed their own version of the program with the idea of mergeing the best parts of each of them into the best game engine we could get.
