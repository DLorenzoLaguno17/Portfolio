description: This project was an Andro Dunos recreation tribute to the original side-scrolling shoot'em up game, purely developed in C++ with SDL by five students on first year. With the possibilities of both playing it as a single player or cooperative game, the players take the control of a spaceship that faces different threats and a final boss that has to overcome in order to achieve the victory. In this tribute we did not reproduce the whole game, but just one of its levels, for which we used existing assets that we took from the original product. Consequently, our work consisted of coding and doing the required QA. 
contribution: 
    - Implemented controller inputs and part of the control of the players.
    - Programmed the behaviour of the turrets, meteorites and most enemy spaceships.
    - Full development of the final boss.
    - Built the level scenery and the collidsion system.
    - Developedment of the graphic user interface and the score tracker.
    - Audio implementation.
    - Finding and fixing bugs or memory leaks.
