description: ViPet is a simple mobile game developed by three third year students in four days using Unity and Vuforia. In it, you take care of a virtual pet, playing with him, feeding and caressing him. He has three different state bars, each one with its own specific related actions, and you have to ensure none of them drops down to 50%. Depending on how he is feeling, the mascot shows his different emotions. We use two AR targets, one for each game scenery.
contribution: 
    - Programmed Caress and Throw the ball actions with Unity's screen touch API.
    - Programmed part of the pet state manager.
    - Implemented Vuforia and linked each target with a different scenery.
    - Development of the graphic user interface.
